<h1>Exploring How Transfer-of-Rights and Guardianship Discussions May Affect Transition Outcomes for Students with Intellectual Disabilities</h1>
<p>Emerging research identifies that during transfer-of-rights discussions, special educators routinely provide guardianship-related information to students with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD) and their parents, contributing to a “school-to-guardianship” pipeline. Because guardianship transfers decision-making authority from student to parent, providing information on guardianship may undermine core aims of special education programs and affect the transition outcomes of students with IDD. The Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston, is partnering with the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State (SANYS), Massachusetts Advocates Standing Strong (MASS), and national experts in guardianship and supported decision-making to explore the relationship between special educators’ transfer-of-rights and guardianship discussions and key predictors of transition outcomes for students with IDD.</p>
